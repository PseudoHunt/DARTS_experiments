Independant claims

Neural Architecture Generation with Diffusion Models:

    DiffusionNAG introduces the use of diffusion models to generate neural architectures. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that perturbs the neural architecture distribution to a known prior distribution, typically Gaussian, and then uses a reverse diffusion process to generate architectures from this noise​

​​

    ​.

Predictor-Guided Generation:

    The framework incorporates parameterized predictors to guide the generative process. These predictors adjust the score function during the reverse diffusion process, ensuring that the generated architectures meet specific desired properties, such as high accuracy or robustness​

​​

    ​.

Efficiency and Computational Savings:

    DiffusionNAG significantly improves the efficiency of neural architecture search (NAS) by reducing the need for repetitive sampling and training of architectures. This leads to substantial computational savings and speedup in the architecture generation process, achieving up to 35 times speedup compared to traditional methods​

​​

    ​.

Support for Transferable NAS:

    The framework supports Transferable NAS by leveraging dataset-aware predictors conditioned on specific datasets. This allows for efficient adaptation to new tasks and datasets without retraining the predictors, enhancing the practicality and scalability of the method across various applications​

    ​.

Single Training for Score Network:

    The score network, which approximates the score function in the reverse diffusion process, is trained only once for each search space. This reduces the training overhead and allows for efficient generation of architectures with varying target properties by simply changing the predictor​
